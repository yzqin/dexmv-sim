DexMV is a novel system and pipeline for learning dexterous manipulation from human demonstration videos.
This repo contains the **simulated environment** and **retargeting** code for DexMV.
The learning part for DexMV is maintained
in [dexmv-learn](https://github.com/yzqin/dexmv-learn).

Pretrained model are provided to try our environment without training. Demonstrations generated by DexMV pipeline are
also provided if you want to try from scratch.

## Installation

1. Install the MuJoCo. It is recommended to use conda to manage python package:

Install MuJoCo from: http://www.mujoco.org/ and put your MuJoCo licence to your install directory. If you already have
MuJoCo on your computer, please skip this step. Note that we use MuJoCo 2.0 for our experiments.

2. Install Python dependencies Create a conda env with all the Python dependencies.

```bash
# Download the code from this repo for the simulated environment, retargeting and examples
git clone https://github.com/yzqin/dexmv-sim
export DEXMV_PACKAGE_PATH=`pwd`
cd dexmv-sim

# The provoided package version in the yml is our testing environment, you do not need to follow the version of each python package precisely to run this code.
conda env create -f environment.yml 
conda activate dexmv
pip install -e .

# Download the code from dexmv-learn repo for the RL/Imitation algorithm.
# dexmv-learn is necessary in order to test on pretrained model or train from scratch, either with RL or with imitation.
cd $DEXMV_PACKAGE_PATH
git clone https://github.com/yzqin/dexmv-learn
cd dexmv-learn
pip install -e .
cd mjrl
pip install -e .
```

3. The file structure is listed as follows:

`dexmv-sim/hand_imitation/`: environments, kinematics retargeting, and demonstration generation

`dexxmv-sim/hand_imitation/hand_imitation/kinematics`: kinematics retargeting and demonstration generation

`examples/`: example code to try DexMV

`dexmv-learn/`: training and inference for RL/Imitation learning algorithm

## Visualize Pretrained Policy

### Relocate

You may need to setup the MuJoCo related environment variables, e.g. `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` before running the code.

```bash
cd DEXMV_PACKAGE_PATH/examples
python visualize_policy.py --env_name=relocate --object_name=tomato_soup_can # for relocate task
```

You can also try different object_name: mug, sugar_box, large_clamp, mustard_bottle, potted_meat_can, foam_brick

If it does not work for you, please check the GitHub issues for more
discussion: https://github.com/openai/mujoco-py/issues/268

### Pour and Place Inside

```
python visualize_policy.py --env_name=pour # run this in the `example` directory
python visualize_policy.py --env_name=place_inside
```

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter the following error:

```bash
ERROR: GLEW initalization error: Missing GL version
```

This is an issue related to MuJoCo OpenGL renderer. A quick fix is modifying the dynamic library loading order by:

```bash
export LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libGLEW.so
```

## Train from scratch

### Download processed demonstrations

First download the demonstrations from
the [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1v-SezFDQBcgekHZBlqulqa8rIgn0iwRT/view?usp=sharing) and place all
the `.pkl` file in the `dexmv-sim/demonstrations` directory.

### Training config

We use a config system to specify the training parameters, including task, object, imitation learning algorithm or RL
only. For convenience, we have provided several config files for you.

### Training

For example, if you want to train relocate mug task using DAPG with demonstrations:

```bash
# Download processed demonstrations first before training
python train.py --cfg configs/dapg-mug-example.yaml  # run this in the `example` directory
```

Similarly, there are several config files for other tasks and algorithms in the `example/configs` directory you can use
for training.

## Hand Motion Retargeting

In this repo, we provide an minimal example for retargeting the human hand to robot hand. The pose data of an example
trajectory are also provided here for convenience.

The following code takes the human hand pose estimation results and retargets it to robot joint position sequence. The
result sequence will be saved as `example_retargeting.pkl`

```bash
python retarget_human_hand.py --hand_dir=./retargeting_source/relocate_mustard_example_seq/hand_pose --output_file=example_retargeting.pkl
```

To visualize the retargeted robot trajectory along with the object, you can run the following:

```bash
python visualize_retargeting.py --retargeting_result=example_retargeting.p --object_dir=./retargeting_source/relocate_mustard_example_seq/object_pose
```

**Note:** Demonstration generation is more than hand motion retargeting. It also involves trajectory generation, time
alignment, inverse dynamics and hindsight, to match the state and action space defined by RL environment. Please check
the [demo_generation.md](docs/demo_gen.md)
